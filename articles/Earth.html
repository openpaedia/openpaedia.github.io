<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body that supports life—a privilege largely due to its vast, life-sustaining global ocean. This immense body of water, which holds roughly 1.335 billion cubic kilometers of liquid, blankets about 70.8% of the planet’s surface and plays a pivotal role in regulating climate, supporting marine biodiversity, and driving weather systems. The remaining 29.2% of the surface is comprised of continental landmasses, which host a variety of climates and ecosystems ranging from humid, vegetation-rich regions to expansive polar ice sheets that collectively store more water than all of Earth’s lakes, rivers, and groundwater. Beneath these surfaces, Earth’s outer shell is segmented into slowly drifting tectonic plates whose interactions produce mountain ranges, trigger volcanic activity, and generate earthquakes. Deep within the planet, a liquid outer core made mostly of molten iron and nickel circulates to produce a robust magnetosphere—an invisible shield that extends tens of thousands of kilometers into space and deflects destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

Earth’s dynamic atmosphere, composed primarily of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with traces of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases, is critical in maintaining surface conditions favorable to life. The pervasive water vapor forms extensive cloud cover that not only moderates temperature but also contributes to the greenhouse effect by trapping solar energy. This process, reinforced by other greenhouse gases, keeps the average surface temperature at a stable 14.76 °C (58.57 °F) and ensures that water remains in its liquid state under typical atmospheric pressures. With a gravitational pull of approximately 9.81 meters per second squared at sea level, Earth is able to retain this atmosphere, which, combined with the differential heating between the equator and the poles, drives complex atmospheric and ocean currents. These currents redistribute heat globally, produce varied climate regions, and sustain weather phenomena like precipitation that are essential for nutrient cycles such as the nitrogen cycle.

Shaped into an oblate spheroid with a circumference of roughly 40,000 kilometers, Earth is not only the densest of the Solar System’s planets but also the largest and most massive among the rocky, terrestrial bodies. Orbiting the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million kilometers—roughly eight light-minutes away—the planet takes about 365.25 days to complete one revolution, while a single rotation on its axis lasts approximately 23 hours and 56 minutes. The axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane is responsible for the seasonal variations experienced across the globe. Earth’s only natural satellite, the Moon, orbits at an average distance of 384,400 kilometers and, due to tidal locking, always presents the same face to the planet. The Moon’s gravitational influence not only stabilizes Earth’s axial tilt but also drives the ocean tides and gradually decelerates the planet’s rotation.

Formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago from the gas and dust of the early Solar System, Earth’s early history was marked by rapid cooling, heavy bombardment from asteroids and comets, and vigorous volcanic activity that laid the groundwork for its oceans. Within the first billion years, these primordial waters became the cradle for life, which emerged and evolved over billions of years. A significant turning point was the Great Oxidation Event, around 2.4 billion years ago, when photosynthetic organisms began to alter the atmosphere by producing oxygen on a massive scale. Human beings, whose evolutionary origins trace back roughly 300,000 years in Africa, have since spread across every continent, relying on Earth’s intricate biosphere and natural resources. However, the accelerated pace of industrialization and environmental exploitation in recent centuries has disrupted these natural systems, driving climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation that now threaten the stability of life on our planet.
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>Modern English “Earth” originated from the Old English noun eorðe, which passed through Middle English before evolving into its present form. Cognates of this term appear throughout every Germanic language, supporting the reconstruction of its ancestral form as *erþō. In its earliest use, eorðe translated the broad range of meanings found in Latin terra and Greek γῆ (gē), covering not only the ground, soil, and dry land but also the human world, the surface of the world—including the sea—and even the entire globe. This linguistic versatility mirrors that found in other ancient cultures; as the Romans personified their world through Terra or Tellūs and the Greeks through Gaia, Germanic paganism similarly may have revered Earth as a goddess, exemplified by the Norse figure Jörð, a giantess regarded as Thor’s mother.

The written form of “earth” has also evolved over time. In Early Middle English, the term was typically rendered in lowercase—“the earth”—to denote the planet as a singular entity. By the Early Modern English period, the growing tendency to capitalize nouns led to “the Earth” becoming common, especially in astronomical contexts where it was mentioned alongside other celestial bodies. Today, while many scientific and formal texts opt for the capitalized “Earth” in line with the names of other planets, both “earth” and “the earth” remain widely used. Style guides such as Oxford’s generally favor the lowercase as the standard form, though they accept the capitalized variant when Earth functions as a proper noun (as in “Earth’s atmosphere”), reserving the lowercase when preceded by “the” (as in “the atmosphere of the earth”). In colloquial expressions, the lowercase is almost universally preferred, as in the familiar phrase “what on earth are you doing?”

Beyond its everyday use, alternative names for our planet have found favor in various contexts. In scientific literature and science fiction, the Latin-derived Terra (/ˈtɛrə/) is sometimes used to clearly distinguish humanity’s world from other planets, while in poetic settings Tellus (/ˈtɛləs/) has served to personify the Earth. Romance languages—descendants of Latin—continue this tradition; Italian and Portuguese, for example, use Terra as the name of the planet, whereas Spanish and French have developed slightly modified forms, such as Tierra and Terre. The Greek poetic name Gaia (Γαῖα) has also lent its form to modern usage in the variant Gæa or Gaea. Although this form was once rare in English, it has become more common in discussions of the Gaia hypothesis, which posits that the Earth operates as a self-regulating system. Notably, in this context the pronunciation has shifted to /ˈɡaɪ.ə/ from the classical /ˈɡeɪ.ə/.

Numerous adjectives have been derived from these ancient names. The word “earthly” comes directly from Earth, while adjectives such as terran (/ˈtɛrən/), terrestrial (/təˈrɛstriəl/), and, through French influence, terrene (/təˈriːn/) all originate from Latin Terra. Similarly, adjectives like tellurian (/tɛˈlʊəriən/) and telluric, which stem from Latin Tellus, are frequently used in geology and related scientific fields to describe phenomena related to our planet. These linguistic developments not only illustrate the rich cultural and mythological heritage surrounding our understanding of the planet but also highlight how Earth’s name continues to adapt to the needs of scientific discourse and everyday language alike.</p>

<h2>Natural history</h2>
<p>The oldest known material in the Solar System has been precisely dated to about 4.5682 billion years ago, establishing an early marker for our cosmic history. By roughly 4.54 billion years ago, the primordial Earth had already formed. The formation of the Solar System began when a region of a molecular cloud underwent gravitational collapse, creating a rotating solar nebula filled with gas, ice grains, dust, and primordial nuclides. As this nebula flattened into a circumstellar disk, tiny particles accreted into planetesimals, and over a period estimated at 70 to 100 million years, these planetesimals coalesced to form the early Earth.

The age of the Moon is estimated to be around 4.5 billion years, though some models suggest it could be significantly younger. A widely accepted hypothesis proposes that a Mars-sized body, known as Theia and containing roughly 10% of Earth's mass, collided with the early Earth. This glancing impact ejected material from Earth’s outer layers, which eventually accreted to form the Moon. Additionally, during the Late Heavy Bombardment between about 4.0 and 3.8 billion years ago, a flurry of asteroid impacts profoundly reshaped the surfaces of both the Moon and Earth.

Earth’s atmosphere and oceans emerged primarily from volcanic outgassing. As water vapor and other gases escaped from the planet’s interior, the vapor eventually condensed to form oceans—a process further supplemented by water and ice delivered by asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. There is evidence that enough water might have been present on Earth since its formation to fill the oceans. Greenhouse gases in the early atmosphere played a crucial role in maintaining liquid water despite the young Sun’s output being only about 70% of its current luminosity. By around 3.5 billion years ago, Earth had developed a magnetic field that helped shield its atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.

As the molten outer layer of the planet cooled, the first solid crust formed, likely of a mafic composition. Partial melting of this early crust generated the first continental crust with a more felsic character. Remarkably, grains of zircon found in ancient sedimentary rocks indicate that felsic crust may have existed as early as 4.4 billion years ago, a mere 140 million years after Earth’s birth. Competing models suggest that the continental crust either grew steadily over time or formed rapidly during the Archean, with later recycling processes reconciling these views and contributing to the present-day abundance of continental material.

Plate tectonics, driven by the continuous loss of internal heat, has been central to shaping Earth’s surface. Over hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have assembled and broken apart supercontinents. For example, the ancient supercontinent Rodinia began to fragment around 750 million years ago, later recombining as Pannotia between 600 and 540 million years ago, and eventually forming Pangaea, which itself started to break apart approximately 180 million years ago.

Earth’s climatic history has also been marked by dramatic shifts. The most recent sequence of glacial cycles began about 40 million years ago, becoming especially pronounced during the Pleistocene around 3 million years ago. These cycles, recurring roughly every 21,000, 41,000, and 100,000 years, led to repeated periods of extensive glaciation and thaw. The Last Glacial Period, commonly known as the “last ice age,” ended about 11,700 years ago, heralding the modern interglacial era.

Life on Earth began with chemical reactions that produced the first self-replicating molecules nearly 4 billion years ago. By around 3.5 to 3.45 billion years ago, evidence from microfossils and sedimentary structures in ancient rocks indicates that microorganisms had already emerged. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed early life forms to harness solar energy, generating molecular oxygen that accumulated in the atmosphere. This oxygen, in turn, reacted with ultraviolet radiation to form a protective ozone layer, paving the way for more complex life. The development of eukaryotic cells through endosymbiotic events eventually led to multicellular organisms, whose diversification is recorded in a rich fossil history that includes microbial mats, biogenic graphite, and preserved cellular structures.

During the Neoproterozoic era, roughly 1,000 to 539 million years ago, Earth may have experienced near-global glaciations—a scenario often referred to as “Snowball Earth.” This extreme ice age preceded the Cambrian explosion, a period when multicellular life rapidly diversified. Since that explosion around 535 million years ago, Earth has undergone at least five major mass extinction events. The most recent, occurring 66 million years ago, is widely linked to an asteroid impact that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs and many other large species, thereby setting the stage for the rise of mammals and, eventually, human evolution. An African ape species that gained the ability to stand upright several million years ago eventually evolved into modern humans, whose development of agriculture and civilization has dramatically altered the planet’s biosphere.

Looking ahead, Earth’s long-term future is inextricably linked to the evolution of the Sun. In the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity is expected to increase by about 10%, and by 3.5 billion years, it may rise by nearly 40%. This gradual brightening will intensify the inorganic carbon cycle and could eventually reduce atmospheric CO₂ to levels too low to sustain current plant life, potentially within 100 to 900 million years. A loss of vegetation would diminish atmospheric oxygen, rendering the planet uninhabitable for many animal species. Estimates suggest that within roughly 1.5 billion years, Earth’s average temperature could reach 100 °C, leading to the complete evaporation of the oceans and possibly triggering a runaway greenhouse effect within 1.6 to 3 billion years. Even without these extreme conditions, a significant portion of ocean water might be sequestered into the mantle as the planet cools. Ultimately, in about 5 billion years, the Sun is expected to evolve into a red giant, expanding to nearly 1 astronomical unit while shedding about 30% of its mass. Depending on tidal interactions, Earth’s orbit could widen to around 1.7 AU, or the planet might be drawn into the Sun’s outer envelope and vaporized, with its heavier elements eventually sinking to the core of the dying star.</p>
<h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
<p>Earth is nearly a perfect sphere due to hydrostatic equilibrium, boasting an average diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) and ranking as the fifth largest planetary body—and the largest rocky one—in our Solar System. However, Earth’s rapid rotation causes it to bulge at the equator, making its equatorial diameter roughly 43 kilometers (27 miles) greater than the polar diameter. This oblateness, coupled with local topographic extremes, produces measurable variations in Earth’s radius: for instance, the Mariana Trench plunges nearly 10,925 meters (35,843 feet) below local sea level, slightly reducing the average radius by about 0.17%, while Mount Everest soars 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level, increasing it by approximately 0.14%. In fact, because of the pronounced equatorial bulge, the summit of Ecuador’s Chimborazo volcano—at an elevation of 6,384.4 kilometers (3,967.1 miles) from Earth’s center—is the farthest point from the planet’s center. Geodesists measure these irregularities by modeling an idealized “geoid,” a smooth yet uneven surface representing mean sea level if the oceans were uninterrupted by tides or winds.

Earth’s external boundary, where the atmosphere meets the solid ground and oceans, covers roughly 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles) and is commonly divided into hemispheres by both latitude and longitude. The vast majority of this surface—about 70.8% or 361 million square kilometers (139 million square miles)—is cloaked by the world ocean, a dynamic, interconnected body of saline water partitioned into the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. This immense hydrosphere, which may have once enveloped the entire planet in its early history, shapes vast oceanic basins characterized by features such as abyssal plains, seamounts, submarine volcanoes, trenches, canyons, plateaus, and the continuous mid-ocean ridge system. Seasonal sea ice further modulates the ocean surface at the poles, linking with permafrost and ice sheets to form expansive polar caps.

The remaining 29.2% of Earth’s surface—around 149 million square kilometers (58 million square miles)—consists of continents and islands, dominated by four major landmasses: Africa-Eurasia, America, Antarctica, and Australia. This terrestrial realm presents an astonishing diversity of terrains including mountains, deserts, plains, and plateaus. Elevation on land varies dramatically from the lowest point of approximately –418 meters (–1,371 feet) at the Dead Sea to the towering peak of Mount Everest at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level, with an average elevation of about 797 meters (2,615 feet). Although much of the land supports abundant vegetation, significant portions are covered by ice—accounting for roughly 10% of the surface (excluding areas under permafrost)—or arid deserts, which occupy about 33% of the land area.

At the surface, a thin layer known as the pedosphere, composed of soils that form through ongoing weathering processes, plays a critical role in making land arable. Approximately 10.7% of the land is suitable for agriculture, with 1.3% classified as permanent cropland, amounting to an estimated 16.7 million square kilometers (6.4 million square miles) of cultivated fields and 33.5 million square kilometers (12.9 million square miles) of pastureland. Beneath both the land and ocean floors lies Earth’s crust, which—together with the uppermost portion of the mantle—forms the rigid lithosphere. This crust is differentiated into oceanic sections, primarily basaltic in composition, and continental segments that often include lower-density rocks such as granite, sediments, and metamorphic materials. Remarkably, sedimentary rocks blanket nearly 75% of the continents even though they constitute only about 5% of the crust’s mass.

The dynamic surface of Earth, whether above sea level or on the ocean floor (with an average bathymetric depth of around 4 kilometers), is continually remodeled by a suite of processes. Tectonic plate movements driven by internal forces—such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the gradual reshaping from weathering by ice, water, wind, and temperature variations—interact with biological activity that recycles biomass into soil. The lithosphere itself is fragmented into tectonic plates that drift atop the more pliable asthenosphere. At plate boundaries, convergent interactions may lead to subduction and mountain building, divergent zones create mid-ocean ridges where new crust forms, and transform boundaries result in lateral sliding that often spawns earthquakes. These processes not only recycle much of the oceanic crust, which is typically less than 100 million years old (with the oldest, found in the Western Pacific, dating to around 200 million years), but also contrast sharply with the ancient continental crust, some of which dates back over 4 billion years, as evidenced by zircon minerals.

Earth’s internal structure is layered according to chemical and physical properties. The outer solid silicate crust—varying from about 6 kilometers thick beneath the oceans to 30–50 kilometers under continents—sits atop a highly viscous mantle, and together they form the lithosphere. Below this rigid shell lies the asthenosphere, a less viscous region where convection currents drive the movement of tectonic plates. As depth increases, seismic studies reveal key transitions at roughly 410 and 660 kilometers, marking changes in mantle mineral structures that delineate the upper and lower mantle. Farther below, an extremely low-viscosity liquid outer core surrounds a solid inner core whose radius is about one-fifth of Earth’s. With central temperatures possibly reaching 6,000 °C (10,830 °F) and pressures up to 360 gigapascals (52 million psi), Earth is the densest of the Solar System’s planetary bodies.

With a total mass of approximately 5.97×10^24 kilograms, Earth is composed primarily of iron (32.1% by mass) and oxygen (30.1%), with significant contributions from silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%). Gravitational differentiation has concentrated the denser elements in the core, where iron makes up nearly 88.8% of the material, supplemented by nickel, sulfur, and trace elements. The crust, in contrast, is dominated by oxides—over 99% of it—mainly as silicate minerals and compounds of aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium.

The internal heat of Earth originates from both primordial energy left over from its formation and radiogenic heat generated by the decay of isotopes such as potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. Early in Earth’s history, when short-lived radioactive isotopes were more abundant, the heat production was nearly double that of today, driving more vigorous mantle convection and more frequent volcanic activity, which in turn produced rare igneous rocks like komatiites. Currently, Earth loses heat at an average rate of about 87 mW per square meter, totaling roughly 4.42×10^13 watts globally. This heat escapes through mantle plumes that create hotspots and flood basalts, along mid-ocean ridges where tectonic activity is most intense, and via conduction through the lithosphere, predominantly beneath the oceans.

Gravity near Earth’s surface averages about 9.8 meters per second squared (32 feet per second squared), though local variations occur due to differences in topography, geological structures, and deeper tectonic features, producing measurable gravity anomalies. Meanwhile, the planet’s magnetic field—generated by a dynamo effect in the convecting outer core—extends from deep within Earth to the surface, where it approximates a dipole with magnetic poles near the geographic poles. At the magnetic equator, field strength reaches about 3.05×10^–5 teslas, with a dipole moment around 7.79×10^22 ampere-square meters (as of the year 2000), though this field decreases by nearly 6% per century. The inherent chaos of core convection causes the magnetic poles to wander and occasionally reverse, with the most recent full reversal occurring approximately 700,000 years ago.

This magnetic field not only defines Earth’s magnetosphere—which shields the planet from the charged particles of the solar wind—but also shapes a complex system of plasma regions. The day-side magnetosphere is compressed to about 10 Earth radii, while a long magnetotail extends on the night side. Within this magnetic shield, low-energy particles form the plasmasphere, medium-energy particles generate a ring current, and high-energy particles become trapped in the Van Allen radiation belts. During geomagnetic storms, particles from the magnetotail are funneled along magnetic field lines into the ionosphere, where they interact with atmospheric gases to create the spectacular auroras visible near the polar regions.</p>
<h2>Orbit and rotation</h2>
<p>Earth rotates relative to the Sun with a mean solar day lasting exactly 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds), though tidal deceleration has gradually lengthened this period since the 19th century so that daily variations can be between 0 and 2 milliseconds longer than average. When measured against the fixed stars—a period termed the stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service—Earth completes one rotation in about 86,164.0989 seconds (approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.0989 seconds) in UT1 time. In contrast, if one considers the rotation relative to the moving mean March equinox, when the Sun is positioned 90° on the celestial equator, the period shortens slightly to 86,164.0905 seconds (or 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.0905 seconds), making the sidereal day roughly 8.4 milliseconds shorter than the stellar day.

Excluding the brief streaks of meteors and the orbits of low-flying satellites, celestial objects appear to drift westward across the sky at a steady rate of about 15° per hour, equivalent to 15 arcminutes per minute. Near the celestial equator, this motion corresponds closely to the angular diameter of the Sun or Moon every two minutes—a remarkable coincidence given that both the Sun and the Moon have nearly identical apparent sizes when viewed from Earth.

Orbiting the Sun as the third-closest planet in the inner Solar System, Earth maintains an average distance of roughly 150 million kilometers (93 million miles), a measure that defines the astronomical unit (AU). This distance translates to about 8.3 light minutes or approximately 380 times the separation between Earth and the Moon. Over the course of 365.2564 mean solar days—a sidereal year—Earth advances in its orbit such that the Sun appears to move eastward by roughly 1° per day, or about one apparent diameter every 12 hours. This apparent motion necessitates a full 24-hour rotation on its axis for the Sun to return to the meridian, defining our solar day.

Traveling at an average orbital speed of approximately 29.78 km/s (or roughly 107,200 km/h and 66,600 mph), Earth covers vast distances in remarkably short times: it could traverse a distance equal to its own diameter of about 12,742 km (7,918 miles) in just seven minutes, and it would cover the 384,400 km (238,900 miles) separating it from the Moon in roughly 3.5 hours.

The Earth–Moon system itself is dynamically intertwined, with both bodies orbiting their common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the fixed stars. However, when this mutual orbit is combined with the Earth’s journey around the Sun, the synodic month—the interval from one new moon to the next—extends to approximately 29.53 days. Viewed from above the celestial north pole, Earth, the Moon, and their rotations all move in a counterclockwise direction; likewise, when observed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth’s north poles, Earth’s orbit around the Sun is also counterclockwise. Despite this uniformity in direction, the planes of orbit and rotation are not perfectly aligned. Earth's rotational axis is inclined by about 23.44° relative to the perpendicular of the ecliptic, and the Earth–Moon orbital plane itself can tilt up to ±5.1° relative to the ecliptic. This misalignment prevents eclipses from occurring every two weeks—a scenario that would arise if the planes were exactly aligned.

Within the vast gravitational interplay of the Solar System, Earth’s sphere of influence, or Hill sphere, extends roughly 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from its center. Within this boundary, Earth’s gravitational pull prevails over that of the Sun and other planets, ensuring that objects remain bound to our planet if they orbit within this distance. On a galactic scale, Earth, along with the entire Solar System, orbits the center of the Milky Way at a distance of about 28,000 light-years, and it resides approximately 20 light-years above the galactic plane within the Orion Arm.

Earth’s axial tilt—measured at about 23.439281°—ensures that its axis remains pointed toward the celestial poles, and this inclination is the primary driver behind the variation in sunlight received across different regions during the year. As a result, when the Tropic of Cancer tilts toward the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere enjoys summer while the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter, with the roles reversed when the Tropic of Capricorn is sunward. During summer, days are longer and the Sun climbs higher in the sky, while winter brings shorter days and cooler temperatures. In the extreme polar regions above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle, prolonged periods of darkness—known as polar nights—can last for several months, whereas during their respective summers these regions experience the phenomenon of the midnight sun, with the Sun visible around the clock.

Seasonal changes are defined astronomically by the solstices and equinoxes. The solstices mark the points of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun, while the equinoxes occur when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital plane. In the Northern Hemisphere, the winter solstice typically falls around December 21, the summer solstice around June 21, the spring equinox near March 20, and the autumnal equinox around September 22 or 23; the Southern Hemisphere observes the opposite pattern, with the seasons effectively reversed.

Over long periods, the angle of Earth’s axial tilt remains relatively stable, although it does experience nutation—a subtle, irregular oscillation with a primary cycle of about 18.6 years. Furthermore, the orientation of Earth's axis slowly precesses in a complete circle roughly every 25,800 years, a gradual movement that accounts for the discrepancy between the sidereal and tropical years. These changes, driven by the gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge, also lead to minor shifts of the poles across the surface, a phenomenon characterized by various cyclical components including an annual cycle and the 14-month Chandler wobble. Such variations contribute to observable changes in Earth's rotational velocity, known as length-of-day variations.

Earth’s annual orbit around the Sun is elliptical rather than perfectly circular, with the planet reaching its closest point—perihelion—around January 3 and its farthest point—aphelion—around July 4. This elliptical nature results in an approximate 6.8% increase in solar energy received at perihelion compared to aphelion. Furthermore, because the Southern Hemisphere is generally tilted toward the Sun at the time of perihelion, it receives a slightly greater annual solar energy input than the Northern Hemisphere, although the influence of axial tilt remains the dominant factor in seasonal energy distribution. Much of the additional energy absorbed in the Southern Hemisphere is moderated by the extensive coverage of water, which has a high heat capacity and helps stabilize temperature fluctuations.</p>    
<h2>Earth–Moon system</h2>
<p>Earth’s only natural satellite is unusually large for a moon—it measures roughly one-quarter the diameter of Earth and is the largest satellite relative to its planet in the Solar System (with the notable exception of Pluto’s Charon). Originally lending its name to all other natural satellites, the Moon is believed to have formed around 4.5 billion years ago as a result of a colossal collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized body known as Theia. This giant-impact hypothesis explains not only the Moon’s lower iron content and depletion of volatile elements compared to Earth but also its surface composition, which closely resembles that of Earth’s crust. Some computer models even suggest that remnants of Theia might still be embedded deep within our planet.

The gravitational relationship between Earth and the Moon has profound and measurable effects. The Moon’s gravity drives the ocean tides, causing the regular rise and fall of sea levels, while its own rotation has become tidally locked—meaning it rotates once on its axis in the same time it takes to orbit Earth—so that we always see the same face. As it journeys around Earth, varying sunlight creates the familiar lunar phases that have guided calendars and cultures for millennia. At the same time, tidal interactions are gradually pushing the Moon away at about 38 millimeters per year, while Earth's rotation slows by roughly 23 microseconds annually. Over hundreds of millions of years, these minute changes have significantly altered the length of days and even the number of days in a year; during the Ediacaran period, for instance, a year may have contained around 400 days, each lasting just under 22 hours.

Beyond affecting tides and rotation, the Moon has played a crucial role in stabilizing Earth’s axial tilt, which helps moderate the planet’s climate and seasonal variations. Some scientists argue that without this stabilizing influence, Earth’s tilt might have varied chaotically—potentially leading to extreme and unpredictable climate shifts that could have disrupted the development of complex life.

From our perspective on Earth, the Moon appears nearly the same size as the Sun in the sky—a cosmic coincidence that arises because the Moon’s diameter is about 400 times smaller than the Sun’s, yet it is roughly 400 times closer to us. This perfect balance makes it possible for both total and annular solar eclipses to occur, events that have long fascinated humanity and provided unique opportunities for scientific discovery.

In addition to the Moon, Earth shares its orbit with several small celestial companions. Among these are quasi-satellites—asteroids that follow horseshoe-shaped paths relative to Earth—with at least seven known examples, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, ranging in size from a few meters to several kilometers. Another intriguing companion, the asteroid 2010 TK7, occupies a stable position near the L4 Lagrange point, while the small near-Earth object 2006 RH120 occasionally enters a temporary orbit around Earth during its close approaches every couple of decades.

Complementing these natural neighbors, our planet is encircled by a vast array of human-made satellites. As of September 2021, there were approximately 4,550 operational satellites serving roles from communications to weather monitoring, along with numerous defunct satellites—such as Vanguard 1, the oldest still in orbit—and more than 16,000 tracked pieces of space debris. The International Space Station stands out as the largest and most prominent artificial satellite, representing a hub for scientific research and international collaboration in space exploration.</p>
<h2>Hydrosphere</h2>
<p>Earth's hydrosphere encompasses all water found on, under, and above the planet’s surface. Most of this water exists in the global ocean, which covers approximately 361.8 million km² (139.7 million sq mi) with an average depth of around 3,682 meters (12,080 ft). This immense ocean holds roughly 1.332 billion km³ (320 million cu mi) of water and has a mass of about 1.35×10^18 metric tons—nearly 1/4400 of Earth’s total mass. If the entire crust were leveled into a smooth sphere, the uniform depth of the ocean would be about 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi). Approximately 97.5% of this water is saline, while the remaining 2.5% is freshwater. Of the freshwater, roughly 68.7% is locked up in ice caps and glaciers, with the rest divided into about 30% groundwater, 1% surface water—spread over only 2.8% of the land—and minor amounts stored in permafrost, atmospheric vapor, and biological reservoirs.

In the coldest regions, persistent snow that survives summer transforms into ice, gradually accumulating to form glaciers and vast polar ice sheets. Alpine glaciers in mountainous areas and extensive ice sheets in polar regions flow under their own gravity, reshaping the landscape by carving out U-shaped valleys and other distinctive features. Sea ice in the Arctic, for instance, spans an area roughly equivalent to that of the United States, although it is retreating rapidly due to climate change.

The average ocean salinity is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5%), a result of salts released by volcanic activity and the weathering of igneous rocks over geological time. These oceans also serve as significant reservoirs for dissolved atmospheric gases, essential for marine life. Acting as giant heat sinks, the oceans moderate Earth’s climate; shifts in ocean temperature distributions, such as those seen in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, can lead to dramatic weather changes around the globe.

Earth’s extensive supply of liquid water is a unique characteristic among Solar System bodies. While some planets with thick atmospheres do contain water vapor, they lack the surface conditions needed for stable bodies of liquid water. Although certain moons exhibit signs of subsurface liquid water reservoirs—potentially even surpassing Earth’s ocean volume—these are typically concealed beneath several kilometers of ice, underscoring the distinctiveness of Earth’s accessible and dynamic hydrosphere.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>At sea level, Earth’s atmospheric pressure averages about 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi) and exhibits a scale height of roughly 8.5 km (5.3 mi). In its dry state, the atmosphere is composed primarily of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, and 0.934% argon, along with trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases, while water vapor—varying from as little as 0.01% to as much as 4%—typically averages near 1%. Approximately two-thirds of the planet is covered by clouds, with a higher frequency over the oceans than over land, and the depth of the troposphere itself fluctuates with latitude, measuring around 8 km at the poles and reaching up to 17 km at the equator due to both geographic and seasonal factors.

The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis roughly 2.7 billion years ago dramatically transformed Earth’s early reducing atmosphere into the nitrogen–oxygen mixture we observe today. This pivotal change not only supported the rise of aerobic organisms but also facilitated the formation of the ozone layer through the conversion of oxygen (O₂) into ozone (O₃), thereby shielding the surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation and enabling life to flourish on land. In addition to providing radiation protection, the atmosphere plays a vital role in distributing water vapor, causing incoming meteors to burn up before reaching the surface, and regulating temperature through the greenhouse effect. In this process, trace gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone trap thermal energy emitted by the surface, raising the average global temperature from an estimated −18 °C (0 °F)—a level inhospitable to modern life—to around +15 °C (59 °F).

There is no abrupt boundary where Earth’s atmosphere ends; rather, it gradually thins until it merges with outer space. Nearly three-quarters of the atmospheric mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) above the surface—the troposphere—where solar energy heats both the air and the land, causing expansion, rising warm air, and subsequent replacement by cooler, denser air. This dynamic cycle of rising and falling air masses drives atmospheric circulation, which is instrumental in redistributing thermal energy and shaping global weather patterns. The primary circulation bands include the equatorial trade winds, which prevail below 30° latitude, and the mid-latitude westerlies, dominant between 30° and 60° latitude, while oceanic processes such as the thermohaline circulation transport heat from equatorial waters to polar regions.

Earth receives about 1361 W/m² of solar irradiance, but the effective energy reaching the surface diminishes with increasing latitude. This reduction occurs because sunlight strikes higher latitudes at lower angles and must traverse a thicker atmospheric layer, leading to a decrease in mean annual sea-level temperature by roughly 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude away from the equator. Consequently, the planet’s surface is divided into distinct climatic belts—tropical, subtropical, temperate, and polar—each characterized by relatively homogeneous temperature and precipitation patterns. Local climates are further influenced by factors such as proximity to oceans, prevailing wind directions, and topographical variations; for example, coastal regions tend to experience milder conditions due to the ocean’s ability to store and slowly release heat, while mountainous areas are typically colder because temperatures drop with increasing altitude.

Surface evaporation generates water vapor that is transported by atmospheric circulation. When warm, moist air rises and cools, the water condenses into clouds and eventually precipitates, providing essential moisture that sustains terrestrial ecosystems and drives geological erosion over time. Precipitation can vary enormously from region to region, ranging from several meters of rainfall per year in some tropical areas to less than a millimeter in arid zones. One widely used method to classify these diverse climatic conditions is the Köppen system, which divides Earth’s climate into five broad groups—humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental, and cold polar—further subdivided based on observed temperature and precipitation data. This classification reflects the extreme range of surface temperatures found on Earth, from highs of approximately 55 °C (131 °F) in scorching desert environments such as Death Valley to lows nearing −89 °C (−128 °F) in Antarctica.

Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is stratified into several layers—the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere—each with its own temperature gradient or lapse rate. Within the stratosphere lies the ozone layer, which absorbs a significant portion of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Beyond these layers, the exosphere gradually fades into the magnetosphere, where Earth’s geomagnetic field interacts with the solar wind. The widely recognized boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space is marked by the Kármán line, located roughly 100 km (62 mi) above the surface. Although the atmosphere is held in place by gravity, thermal energy occasionally propels some molecules, particularly lightweight hydrogen, to speeds sufficient to escape into space. This slow loss of hydrogen has played a critical role in shifting Earth’s early reducing atmosphere to its current oxidizing state—a change that, combined with the oxygen produced by photosynthesis, has been crucial in shaping the evolution and diversity of life on our planet. In today’s oxygen-rich environment, most hydrogen is converted into water before it escapes, with the primary loss now stemming from the breakdown of methane in the upper atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Life on Earth</h2>
<p>Earth is the only known celestial body where life has taken hold, a unique haven that has supported a remarkable diversity of organisms over billions of years. Life began in Earth's primordial waters, with the earliest microorganisms emerging a few hundred million years after the planet formed. These simple life forms evolved in environments rich in liquid water—an essential medium that allowed complex organic molecules to assemble and interact, and that provided the energy needed for metabolism. Over time, these early organisms diversified and spread across a wide range of ecosystems, eventually creating an interconnected global biosphere that spans terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats.

The evolution of life has not been a passive process; it has actively reshaped Earth’s environment. For example, the advent of photosynthesis in ancient microbes led to a gradual increase in atmospheric oxygen, culminating in the Great Oxidation Event about 2.4 billion years ago. This dramatic rise in oxygen levels transformed the planet’s atmosphere and enabled the development of more complex, multicellular organisms that rely on aerobic respiration. As life diversified, distinct biomes emerged, each defined by specific climatic conditions such as temperature, humidity, and elevation. Equatorial forests and shallow marine environments, where warm, humid conditions prevail, are among the most biodiverse regions on Earth, while the extreme cold of polar regions, the high altitudes of mountainous areas, and the severe dryness of deserts support far fewer species.

Earth’s ability to support life is also tied to its effective nutrient cycling. Plants, animals, and microorganisms continuously absorb and recycle essential nutrients from water, soil, and the atmosphere, maintaining a delicate balance that sustains the myriad forms of life. This intricate web of biological interactions has been refined over eons, underpinning the resilience and productivity of ecosystems.

In addition to these biological processes, Earth experiences a wide range of extreme weather events and natural disasters that have profound impacts on both human populations and natural systems. Tropical cyclones—including hurricanes and typhoons—are widespread phenomena that have, between 1980 and 2000, resulted in nearly 12,000 human deaths per year on average. Beyond these storms, the planet is also subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, and wildfires. Each of these events has contributed to shaping the physical and biological landscapes of Earth.

Human activity has added another layer of complexity to these natural processes. Industrial pollution has degraded air and water quality, while practices such as deforestation, overgrazing, and unsustainable land use have led to habitat loss, soil degradation, and even desertification. The release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and other human activities is driving global warming, which in turn is accelerating the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, raising global sea levels, and intensifying extreme weather events. These changes not only threaten human settlements but also force species to shift their ranges, often migrating toward cooler regions and altering established ecological balances.</p>
<h2>Human geography</h2>
<p>Humans evolved from earlier primates in Eastern Africa roughly 300,000 years ago, eventually migrating across the globe. With the emergence of agriculture around the 10th millennium BC, communities began to settle more permanently, marking a shift from nomadic lifestyles to established civilizations. By the 20th century, even Antarctica had experienced its first human visits, though it remains one of the least populated regions on Earth.

Since the 19th century, the human population has grown at an unprecedented rate—from around one billion in the early 1800s to nearly seven billion in the early 2010s—and is projected to peak at approximately ten billion later in the 21st century, with sub-Saharan Africa poised to experience the most significant growth. Population distribution is highly uneven; most people live in South and Eastern Asia, and about 90% of humanity resides in the Northern Hemisphere, which contains 68% of the planet's land mass. This period has also witnessed a dramatic shift towards urbanization, with the majority of people now living in cities.

Human activity is almost entirely concentrated on Earth’s surface, with only temporary and specialized settlements established deep underground, underwater, or in space. Since the latter half of the 20th century, a few hundred individuals have spent time in space, and only a handful have set foot on the Moon, underscoring humanity’s continuing dependence on Earth’s environment.

The spread of human civilization has led to the development of diverse societies and cultures, with nearly all terrestrial land now claimed by sovereign states—205 of which exist today. Most of these states are members of the United Nations, an organization that plays a crucial role in global governance, extending its reach even to oceans and parts of Antarctica.

Humans have extensively exploited Earth’s natural resources. Non-renewable resources like coal, petroleum, and natural gas are formed over millions of years within the crust and are extracted for energy and chemical production. Similarly, mineral ore bodies, created through processes such as magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics, are mined for metals and other elements, though this extraction often comes with environmental and health risks. The biosphere, meanwhile, provides essential products such as food, timber, pharmaceuticals, and oxygen, while also playing a key role in recycling organic waste. In 2019, forests and woodlands covered about 39 million square kilometers, shrub and grasslands spanned 12 million square kilometers, roughly 40 million square kilometers were used for animal feed production and grazing, and croplands accounted for 11 million square kilometers. Of the ice-free land used for agriculture, approximately 12–14% is cultivated as croplands, with a small fraction being irrigated.

Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly altered Earth’s climate by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. By 2020, global temperatures were estimated to be about 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) above preindustrial levels, a change that has accelerated glacial melting, raised sea levels, and heightened the risks of drought, wildfires, and shifts in species distributions. The concept of planetary boundaries has been developed to quantify these impacts; of the nine identified boundaries, five—biosphere integrity, climate change, chemical pollution, the destruction of wild habitats, and the nitrogen cycle—have been exceeded. As of 2018, no country managed to meet its population’s basic needs without surpassing at least one of these limits, although research suggests that it is still possible to satisfy essential human requirements within sustainable resource use</p>
<h2>Cultural and historical viewpoint</h2>
<p>Human cultures have long fashioned diverse representations and beliefs about Earth. For instance, ancient astronomical symbols like the quartered circle (🜨), which signifies the four corners of the world, and the globus cruciger (♁) reflect deep-rooted ideas about Earth's structure and its role in the cosmos. In many societies, Earth is personified as a deity—often revered as a mother goddess responsible for fertility and life—mirroring the way various cultures, from the ancient Mesopotamians to the indigenous peoples of the Americas, wove the planet into their religious and mythological narratives. Creation myths abound worldwide, typically depicting Earth as a product of divine intervention or the creative work of multiple deities. In a more modern vein, the Gaia hypothesis, popularized in the mid-20th century by scientists like James Lovelock, presents Earth as a single, self-regulating organism whose interconnected systems work together to stabilize the environment and sustain life.

The way people perceive Earth was profoundly altered by the striking images captured during space missions, especially those of the Apollo program. These photographs fostered the so-called overview effect—a cognitive shift where viewers recognized not only the planet’s breathtaking beauty and uniqueness but also its vulnerability. This newfound perspective has been crucial in highlighting the extensive impact of human activity on Earth's delicate ecosystems. Advanced Earth observation technologies now provide detailed insights into climate change, deforestation, pollution, and other environmental issues, spurring global initiatives and policies aimed at protecting the planet.

Scientific inquiry has continuously reshaped humanity’s understanding of Earth. In ancient Greece, the early transition from a flat Earth conception to a spherical one is credited to philosophers such as Pythagoras and Parmenides, laying the groundwork for later astronomical discoveries. For centuries, Earth was seen as the fixed center of the universe until the revolutionary ideas of the 16th century redefined it as one of several planets in a dynamic Solar System. Geological studies further transformed our view of the planet: during the 19th century, scientists began to recognize that Earth’s age extended far beyond the few million years previously imagined. Lord Kelvin’s thermodynamic estimates in 1864, which ranged from 20 million to 400 million years, sparked intense debate until the discovery of radioactivity and the advent of radioactive dating methods in the late 19th and early 20th centuries conclusively demonstrated that Earth is billions of years old.</p>
