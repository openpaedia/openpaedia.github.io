JavaScript: Making Web Pages Interactive

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

In this wiki, JavaScript is used to:
- Fetch the list of articles.
- Handle user input in the search box.
- Filter articles based on the search query.
- Fetch and display the content of selected text files.
