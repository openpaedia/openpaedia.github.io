CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is used to style and lay out web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

Selectors target HTML elements, and properties define their appearance. Example:

p {
  color: navy;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
